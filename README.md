# üõ†Ô∏è Custom Authentication API with NestJS, MongoDB & JWT

This project is a custom-built API developed using **NestJS**, designed to handle core authentication functionality, including **user registration**, **login**, and **user data management**. The backend logic is fully powered by **MongoDB** as the primary database, with seamless integration through **Mongoose** and **Typegoose** for schema modeling and type safety.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Secure endpoints to register new users and authenticate existing ones.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- **JWT Authentication**: Upon successful login or registration, a **JWT token** is generated and returned to the client, enabling secure and stateless session management.
- **MongoDB Integration**: User data is stored and managed via **MongoDB**, using Mongoose and Typegoose for a type-safe and structured approach to data modeling.
- **Modular Structure**: Built with a clean, modular architecture following NestJS best practices, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Environment Configs**: API secrets, DB credentials, and other environment variables are handled through `.env` files for flexibility and security.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **NestJS** ‚Äì Progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose + Typegoose** ‚Äì ODM and type-safe modeling for MongoDB.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** ‚Äì For secure authentication and token management.
- **Bcrypt** ‚Äì For secure password hashing.

## üéØ Usage Example

Frontend can send requests to the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Äì Create a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äì Log in and receive a JWT token

The JWT token can be stored in local storage or cookies and used in headers.
